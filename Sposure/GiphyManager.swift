/**
 * TODO: This loads WAYYYYY more than it needs to and could
 * be HEAVILY optimized.
 * 
 * Currently this loads ALL the gifs URL's available. Like all of them.
 * If Giphy has 50k cat gif URLs, it will load in 50k cat gifs.
 * Granted, it only loads them at 100 per second, but still. 
 *
 * This is going to cause some fairly serious network issues for 
 * folks. This 100% needs to get fixed before this ever hits production.
